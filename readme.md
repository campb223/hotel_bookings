# Hotel Bookings

This project explores a hotel bookings dataset from Kaggle containing 32 features and 119,390 entries from 2015-2017. Its goal is to answer two main questions: when's the best time to travel, and which booking method allows you to do so cheapest?

## Findings

The analysis shows that the fewest people are booking (and staying) between November and March. August is the busiest and most expensive month to stay. Prices start rising in April and begin coming down in September. Booking through a corporate site is typically the cheapest option, followed by using a travel agent site like hotels.com.

Other interesting findings include the fact that people are less likely to cancel bookings at a resort hotel when compared to a city hotel. A surprising takeaway is that roughly 37% of bookings are cancelled, although when looking solely at the United States, itâ€™s roughly 25% cancellations. Attendance of kids is proportionally greater at resort hotels vs city hotels, but not by much. Across both hotel types, kids only make up ~5% of guests.
